Whether it's tempo runs long runs or racing the EVORIDE™ 2 shoe is built for neutral and supinated runners focused on conserving energy.

Additionally the shoe's engineered mesh upper is designed with a multi-directional stretch mesh that adjusts better to the foot's natural shape. The shoe's upper is also made with recycled materials while the sockliner is produced with a solution dyeing process that reduces carbon emissions and water usage. This neutral running style is built on the METARIDE™ shoe philosophy which aims to lessen the overall load via its curved sole. These elements increase running efficiency which helps runners feel fresher for longer durations. Designed to create a comfortable ride the shoe's midsole incorporates FLYTEFOAM™ technology which gives the runner a lightweight feel and more cushioning across longer distances. Lastly the outsole also features AHARPLUS™ technology that's strategically positioned in higher contact areas to improve the shoe's durability.
